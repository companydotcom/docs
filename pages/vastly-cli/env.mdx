The `vastly env` command is used to store and manage secrets and environment variables, providing functionality to add, remove, and pull variables per account. All variables are securely stored using DynamoDB.


## Usage
To leverage the environment variables locally, navigate into the root directory of your working repository and run `vastly env pull`. This will trigger a series of command-line questions prompting you to input a custom file name and choose where in your repo you'd like to write the env file to. Make sure to check your command-line for confirmation or errors. If there are no stored envs for this account, you will be prompted to get started by running `vastly env add`. The first time through, this command will look for an `env` table in the specified account's DynamoDB. If one is not found, it will create one along with adding your first environment variable. After updating environment variables (through `vastly env add`, or `vastly env delete`), you will have the ability to view your variables in real time via the command-line.

    Note that to properly utilize your environment variables locally, you will need to configure access to the `env` file that is created by the `vastly env pull` command
