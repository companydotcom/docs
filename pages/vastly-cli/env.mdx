The `vastly env` command is used to store and manage secrets and environment variables, providing functionality to add, remove, and pull variables per project per environment. All variables are securely stored on your Vastly account using DynamoDB.

To leverage environment variables in locally, run `vastly env pull`. This will trigger a series of command-line questions prompting you to decide which environment (like develop or production) and which project you'd like to pull from. You will then be asked where you'd like the write your `.env` file. Make sure to check your command-line for confirmation or errors. After updating environment variables on vastly (through `vastly env add`, or `vastly env delete`), you will have to run `vastly env pull` again to get the updated values.

    Note that to properly utilize your environment variables locally, you will need to configure access to the `.env` file that is created by the `vastly env pull` command
</Callout>

## ADD
add an environment variable or secret to your managed env service. You have the option to add it to an existing project or create a new project in your secret store
  ```bash copy filename="terminal"
  vastly env add
  ```

## DELETE
remove an environment variable or secret from your managed env service. Specify the project name and environment when prompted. Key name is case sensitive
  ```bash copy filename="terminal"
  vastly env delete
  ```

## PULL
pull all environment variables or secrets from your managed env service and writes them to a `.env` file in the location of your choosing. Specify the project name and environment when prompted
  ```bash copy filename="terminal"
  vastly env pull
  ```
