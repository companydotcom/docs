# Get Started with Figma

The Potion Design System is a comprehensive set of guidelines, components, and standards that fosters consistency and efficiency in the design and development process. It serves as a central reference for design teams, ensuring a unified and seamless user experience across products and platforms. By promoting reusability and standardization, the Potion Design Systems empower teams to work collaboratively and streamline the creation of user interfaces, ultimately resulting in a more polished and coherent digital ecosystem.

## Get Access:

If you would like to get access to the Potion Design System you can do so my [reaching out to us](https://www.company.com). Please be aware that your access will be limited to read only, this means you’ll be able to view our entire design system but would be unable to edit or alter anything. If your interested in getting full access you can do so by [contacting our sales team](https://www.company.com). 

## How it Works:

After you get access you’ll see the default theme applied to components in the design system, this allows a user to grab what feature or component they need and start building their website. If you have your own color pallet that you wish to use then all you would need to do is perform a simple color change and all of the selected component would adhere to the alteration. With Figma, a mass override for a color or style change is effortless.
