# Get Started with Figma

import { LinkCard, LinkCards } from "@components/link-card"

Figma is for people to create, share, and test designs for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products and experiences. This is the primary tool our design team utilizes, in order to get access to our design files we recommend downloading [Figma](https://www.figma.com/downloads/). You can do so by heading over to [Figma’s website](https://www.figma.com) and downloading the latest version.
## Get Access:

If you would like to get access to the Potion Design System you can do so my [reaching out to us](https://www.company.com). Please be aware that your access will be limited to read only, this means you’ll be able to view our entire design system but would be unable to edit or alter anything. If your interested in getting full access you can do so by [contacting our sales team](https://www.company.com). 

## How it Works:

After you get access you’ll see our default theme applied to all of the components in the design system, if you have your own color pallet you can add your own colors and reskin the existing components to match your brand. This allows a user to grab what feature or component they need and start building their website, we also encourage you to upload a picture to the cover board so you can make the project yours. Be sure to update your changes to Figma so you and your team are working with the most current version of the project.
