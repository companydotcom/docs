# Overview

“A design system acts as the connective tissue that holds together your entire platform.”― Drew Bridewell, Invision

We hope you find this section helpful to inform you of how to effectively use the design system and the design system documentation. There are parts of the design system that are currently still under construction but we’ll continue to build and make iterations while keeping you informed. The long-term vision of our design system is to create a seamless and delightful user experience across all our digital products and platforms. By fostering a culture of collaboration, innovation, and user-centricity, our design system will empower teams to build high-quality products efficiently, with consistent branding and design language, and ultimately, drive customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Goals:
* Consistency - Ensure consistent design language, interaction patterns, and branding across all products and platforms to strengthen our brand identity and improve user recognition and trust.
* Efficiency - Streamline the product development process by providing reusable components, standardized guidelines, and documentation, reducing design and development time, and minimizing redundancy.
* Accessibility - Prioritize accessibility in design and development to ensure all users, including those with disabilities, can access and use our products effectively.
* Scalability - Create a design system that can scale and adapt to accommodate new products, features, and technologies as our company grows.
* Collaboration - Encourage cross-functional collaboration between design, development, and product teams to foster a shared understanding of design principles and encourage feedback and iteration.
* User-Centricity - Place users at the heart of the design process, conducting user research and usability testing to continually improve and refine our products' user experience.

In short, the Potion Design System will not be a static entity but will evolve and grow alongside our company and products. Regular reviews and updates will be conducted to ensure the design system remains relevant, innovative, and aligned with our business goals.
