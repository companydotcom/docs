# Overview

The objective of system design is to create a plan for a software or hardware system that meets the
needs and requirements of a customer or user. This plan typically includes detailed specifications
for the system, including its architecture, components, and interfaces. System design is an
important step in the development process of any system, as it serves as the foundation for the
implementation and deployment of the system. A well-designed system can help ensure that the system
is reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.

The design system is in a continuous state of evolving, contents are either being updated or new
contents are being added. At the moment we have some components that are in the design system but
haven’t made it to code yet. We have sections carefully labeled in the DS. If components are “Design
Complete” then they are design complete but waiting to be code complete, if there are components
under “In Progressive” then the design team is still working on the new additions.

As we grow we will identify the needs and requirements of the user or customer, develop a plan for
the system, ensure that the system is reliable and efficient, make the system user-friendly, take
into account any constraints or limitations.
