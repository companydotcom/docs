# Theme

import { LinkCard, LinkCards } from "@components/link-card"

Themes are used to modify existing components to fit a specific visual style. By using Carbon’s
tokens, developers can easily customize all of their components by changing a set of universal
variables, eliminating the need to modify individual components.

## Colors

Each theme is assigned universal color variables, which are determined by common roles and usage.
This allows for uniform color application across themes while maintaining full styling flexibility.

## Typography

Typography has four categories of type styles (universal, productive, editorial, and additional)
that can be customized through tokens. These tokens are used both within components and across
layouts. Type tokens are determined by their role across the system.

## Shadows

Before being a decorative element, shadows were designed to promote user understanding. They bring
additional information on the interface and more specifically on the targeted component. It can
indicate possible interactions or reactions triggered by a user's action.

## Radii

The border-radius CSS property rounds the corners of an element's outer border edge. You can set a
single radius to make circular corners, or two radii to make elliptical corners.

## Breakpoints

A breakpoint is the screen size threshold determined by specific layout requirements. At a given
breakpoint range, the layout adjusts to suit the screen size and orientation.

## Spacing

Spacing is the negative area between elements and components. It is commonly controlled in code with
margin and padding . Carbon offers several methods such as tokens and layout components to make
implementing spacing in product easier and more consistent.
