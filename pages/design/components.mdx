In a design system, there are various components that work together to provide a cohesive and consistent user experience across different products and platforms.

## Buttons

Buttons are a crucial interactive element in user interfaces. Design systems provide guidelines for button styles, sizes, and states (such as hover, active, or disabled) to ensure a consistent look and behavior.

## Form Elements

Design systems provide guidelines for form elements like input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and more. Consistent styling and behavior enhance the user experience and make forms intuitive to use.

## Data Display

Data visualization is the representation of information in pictorial or graphical format, such as charts, graphs, maps, and diagrams. These visuals aid in the communication of complex data so that insights can be more easily drawn.

## Overlay

An overlay provides contextual information and options in form of an additional layer on top of the current state of the interface. They are either purposefully interruptive like modals or augmenting like popovers and tooltips.

## Media & Icons

Media guidelines within a design system help ensure that visuals and multimedia elements are consistent, visually appealing, and aligned with the overall brand and user experience.

## Feedback

Both banners and alerts are essential components in a design system as they contribute to effective communication, provide important notifications, and guide user interactions, thereby improving the overall user experience.

## Disclosure

A disclosure element typically consists of a heading or a trigger element that users can click or interact with to expand or collapse a hidden content area. When expanded, the hidden content is revealed, allowing users to access additional details or options. When collapsed, the content is hidden to reduce clutter and maintain a more focused view.

## Tabs

Tab components in a design system enable users to navigate seamlessly between different sections of content within a single interface, enhancing the usability and organization of complex interfaces. By establishing consistent guidelines for tab design, behavior, and visual indicators, design systems promote a unified and intuitive experience for users across various products and platforms.
