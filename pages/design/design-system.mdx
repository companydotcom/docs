# Design System

import { LinkCard, LinkCards } from "@components/link-card"

The Potion Design System is a comprehensive set of guidelines, standards, and reusable components that provide a unified and consistent framework for designing and building digital products. It serves as a central resource for designers, developers, and other stakeholders, offering a shared language and established patterns to streamline the creation process.

Before you get started, there are a few things we wanted to cover with you. The “Design Complete” section houses new or updated features and components, if something is in here then the design team is done but it hasn’t made it to code yet. The “In Progress” section is where we build new components, this means items in this section are not design complete or code complete. We are still working on the following pages: Modules, Pages, and Guidance.

As you explore the design system documentation you will find pages geared towards sections of the design system, what each section of the design system accomplishes, how to effectively use each section of the design system, and best practices.
