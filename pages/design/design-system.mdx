A design system is a comprehensive set of guidelines, standards, and reusable components that
provide a unified and consistent framework for designing and building digital products. It serves as
a central resource for designers, developers, and other stakeholders, offering a shared language and
established patterns to streamline the creation process.

To use a design system effectively, designers and developers refer to its documentation, which
outlines the principles, rules, and best practices for creating interfaces. They leverage the
system's pre-designed components, such as buttons, typography styles, and icons, to ensure visual
and functional consistency across different screens and platforms.

Design systems are crucial for several reasons. Firstly, they promote efficiency and collaboration
by eliminating redundant design and development work. Secondly, they establish a cohesive user
experience, enhancing usability and familiarity for users across various products and touchpoints.
Thirdly, they facilitate scalability and maintenance, as updates and improvements can be implemented
systematically. Lastly, design systems reinforce brand identity, as they encapsulate the visual and
interactive elements that define an organization's unique style and values.
