# Get Started

Learn how to use the Wave command-line interface (CLI) to configure and manage your Wave Monorepo.

## Wave CLI Overview

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs"
import { Text, SimpleGrid } from "@vastly/ui"

With the command-line interface (CLI) provided through
[`create-wave-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-wave-app), you have access to a wide array
of dev tools to accelerate building on your app!

## Installing Wave CLI

Wave CLI is included as a dependency of `create-wave-app`, but if you need to install or update:

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>```bash copy filename="terminal" npx i -g @vastly/wave ```</Tab>
  <Tab>```bash copy filename="terminal" pnpm add -g @vastly/wave ```</Tab>
</Tabs>
