The `vastly generate` command is used to spin up a microservice (like REST, eda, or streaming service) or CIAM service through the [Vastly CLI](/cli).

## SERVICE
create, manage and deploy a full microservice to connect to your customized front-end application.
  ```bash copy filename="terminal"
  vastly generate service
  ```

### REST
<Callout>
  Be sure to checkout the `README.md` in your `create-wave-app` services directory for more information!
</Callout>
Upon generation, you will be supplied with a typed `prisma/appsync` backend with a configurable database connection, a generic template graphql schema, as well as some generic resolvers to get you started.



### EDA & streaming
<Callout type="info">
Coming soon!
</Callout>

## CIAM

  vastly generate ciam
  ```
