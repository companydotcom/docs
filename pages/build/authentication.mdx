# Authentication

Want to quickly create a secure customer identity and access management service seamlessly? Vastly
has you covered. Built using [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) and
[NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/), we aim to make it trivial to bootstrap your auth experience
and secure your app routes.

<Callout>Ensure you have the [Vasly CLI](/vastly-cli) installed on your machine.</Callout>

## Generating your cIAM

<Steps>
### Step 1

Run the `wave generate ciam` command from the root of your monorepo.

```bash copy filename="terminal"
wave generate ciam
```

### Step 2

The CLI will ask you which auth provider you would like to use. For now, we only support
[Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), but hope to support more options in the near
future. Choose AWS Cognito for now.

### Step 3

At this step, Wave automatically generates some boilerplate code for you to easily modify or
configure as needed.

- In the entry point to your app (typically `_app.tsx` in a Next.js app), a new React provider is
  imported and added - `<SessionProvider>`. This comes from the
  [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) package and ensures you can use their built in hooks that
  handle various responsbilities like user and session data.

```jsx copy filename="_app.tsx"
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps: { session, ...pageProps } }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <UiProvider>
      <ApolloWrapper>
        <SessionProvider session={session}>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </SessionProvider>
      </ApolloWrapper>
    </UiProvider>
  );
}
```

- An `api` folder will be created under your `pages` directory, with a new `auth/[...nextauth].js`
  file.

This file sets up a small api, that lives directly in your app, and wires up that API with your
selected auth provider (in this case, AWS Cognito).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  To get these variables, you need to have an AWS Cognito UserPool setup on your AWS account
  already.
</Callout>

```jsx copy filename="[...nextauth].tsx"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import CognitoProvider from "next-auth/providers/cognito"

export const authOptions = {
  providers: [
    CognitoProvider({
      clientId: "",
      clientSecret: "",
      issuer: ""
    })
  ],
  secret: ""
}

export default NextAuth(authOptions)
```

- Two sample pages are also generated for your benefit, `login.tsx` and a `restricted.tsx`.

The `login.tsx` page demonstrates how to easily use the [NextAuth]() API's to grab a users session,
sign the user into your app, or sign them out.

The `restricted.tsx` page demostrates how to get a users session status, and deny them access to
page, created a secure route.

If you don't require any of these templates, feel free to delete or modify them!
