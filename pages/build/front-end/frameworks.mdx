Every [Wave app](/getting-started/setting-up-your-first-monorepo) gets generated with a default
framework called [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Next.js

Next.js is a popular React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and static websites. It
provides a powerful set of features and optimizations that can greatly enhance the development
experience and performance of your front-end application.

We won't go over every single aspect of the Next.js framework here, but have provided some handy
links and descriptions of some of the features that you will want to be familiar with while building
with Wave.

## Features

### Routing

Next.js uses a
[file based routing system](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).

<Callout>
  Note that Next.js has two strategies around defining routes, the `/app` folder and the `/pages`
  folder. Refer to their docs for the differences.
</Callout>

At a high level, what this means is that either of these folder structures:

<Tabs items={["app folder", "pages folder"]}>
  <Tab>
    <FileTree>
      <FileTree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="dashboard" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="layout.tsx" />
          <FileTree.Folder name="settings" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="page.tsx" />
          </FileTree.Folder>
          <FileTree.Folder name="profile" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="page.tsx" />
          </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <FileTree>
      <FileTree.Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="dashboard" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="settings.tsx" />
          <FileTree.File name="profile.tsx" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Would result in two routes being generated on your frontend `/dashboard/settings` and
`/dashboard/profile`.

### Pages and Layouts

Note in the above project structure the `layout.tsx` file. In Next.js, when you use the `app` folder
structure to generate pages, you can make shareable layout components. This is useful for things
like adding a navbar and footer to every single page, or switching content composition between for
example a blog post versus a dashboard. Each `layout.tsx` file is required to render a `children`
prop.

For more information on how `layout.tsx` files work, check out the
[docs here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts).

There are also many different file conventions that handle different responsibilities, such as
loading states and errr pages. Find out more
[here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions).

### Data Fetching

Data fetching is a big and complex topic, but Next.js has several simple ways to make populating
your Wave app with content an easy-to-understand experience.
[This page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) will go through the
fundamental concepts and patterns to help you manage your data's lifecycle.

### Internationalization

Internationalization of your content is enabled out of the box with Next.js. Several strategies for
fetching and storing all of your language dictionaries are layed out
[here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).
