[Vastly UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vastly/ui) is a React component library built on top of
[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) that helps you build products with speed and confidence.
Utilizing the tooling around themes and design systems that Chakra UI provides, we've built
additional components that will help you, the creator, make the components you need easily.

Every Vastly UI component is:

- Themeable. Customize all your components to match your brand using theme and style props.
- Composable. Combine the components to suit your requirements and blend them together to generate
  unique ones.
- Productive. Created to minimize repetitive code and ensure type safety, and accelerate your
  product development process.

## Components

### Vastly UI

With the `@vastly/ui` package, you have access to every single component from
[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) in addition to a lot more we've built on top of their system.
Some examples include:

- A [Stepper component](https://ui.vastly.is/?path=/docs/components-steppers-labeledstepper--docs)
  with various options to customize as needed
- A [Pagination component](https://ui.vastly.is/?path=/docs/components-pagination--docs) to help you
  easily add pagination to your tables

Plus more on the way!

### Vastly Forms

In addition to core components, we also have a package called `@vastly/forms` that provides several
helpful, composable components that are powered by the popular [`react-hook-form`](https://react-hook-form.com/) library.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  `react-hook-form` is a highly performant and flexible library to help manage all your form state
  and validation. Read more on how it works [here](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started).
</Callout>

Vastly Forms exports several components that can plug into your app and eliminate lots of
boilerplate for you.

To get started, install the `@vastly/forms` package in your client app.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy filename="terminal"
    npm install @vastly/forms
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy filename="terminal"
    yarn add @vastly/forms
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Our custom `<Field />` component,
for example, lets you easily add traditional form inputs like text boxes and select fields, but also
some specialized ones like

- A
  [credit card field](https://ui.vastly.is/?path=/story/@vastly/forms_elements-field--credit-card-input-field)
  with custom masking
- A
  [phone input field](https://ui.vastly.is/?path=/story/@vastly/forms_elements-field--react-phone-input-field)
  to handle international numbers and proper formatting
- A
  [country selector input](https://ui.vastly.is/?path=/story/@vastly/forms_elements-field--select-country-input-field)

Plus [lots more](https://ui.vastly.is/?path=/docs/@vastly/forms_elements-field--docs)!

We also have some custom Form components to easily handle common use cases, such as a Multi-Step Form component, where you may want to collect data in an ordered way.

Simply wrap all your `<Fields />` in the `<StepForm />` component, and seperate your individual screens in a `<FormStep />` wrapper.

```jsx copy filename="step-form.tsx"
import { Form, Field, StepForm, FormLayout, FormStep, NextButton } from "@vastly/forms";

function Example() => {
  const defaultValues = {
    name: "",
    email: "",
    password: "",
  };
  const onSubmit = (params: typeof defaultValues) => {
    console.log(params);
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(resolve, 1000);
    });
  };
  return (
    <StepForm defaultValues={defaultValues} onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <FormLayout>
        <FormStep name="profile">
          <FormLayout>
            <Field name="name" label="Name" rules={{ required: true }} />
            <Field name="email" label="Email" rules={{ required: true }} />
            <NextButton />
          </FormLayout>
        </FormStep>
        <FormStep name="password">
          <FormLayout>
            <Field name="password" label="Password" type="password" rules={{ required: true, minLength: *4 }} />
            <NextButton />
          </FormLayout>
        </FormStep>
      </FormLayout>
    </StepForm>
  );
}
```

It's that simple. You can use any validation library you like, such as [Zod](https://zod.dev/) or [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup).

For more information, be sure to check out the individual component documentation available on our
[Storybook](https://ui.vastly.is/).

## Customization

Creating an app-wide theme is simple with Vastly UI.

<Steps>
### Create a custom theme:
You can create a custom theme by extending the default Vastly UI theme.
Create a new file, for example, `theme.ts`, and define your custom theme there.

```jsx copy filename="theme.ts"
import { extendTheme } from '@vastly/ui';

const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    // Add your custom colors here
    brand: {
      100: '#f7fafc',
      // ...
    },
  },
  fonts: {
    // Add your custom fonts here
    heading: 'Montserrat, sans-serif',
    // ...
  },
  // Add more customizations to your theme if needed
});

export default theme;
```

### Use the custom theme:
Import your custom theme in the root file where you wrapped the UiProvider, and pass it as a
prop to the UiProvider component.

```jsx copy filename="_app.tsx"
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { UiProvider } from "@vastly/ui";
import theme from './theme';

export default function MyApp({
  Component,
  pageProps: { session, ...pageProps },
}: AppProps) {
  return (
    <UiProvider theme={theme}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </UiProvider>
  );
}
```

### Customize component styles:
Vastly UI allows you to override the default styles of its components using the theme object. For
example, to customize the style of the Button component, you can define the styles in your custom
theme file.

```jsx copy filename="theme.ts"
import { extendTheme } from '@vastly/ui';

const theme = extendTheme({
  components: {
    Button: {
      // Customize the button styles
      baseStyle: {
        fontWeight: 'bold',
        borderRadius: 'md',
      },
      // ...
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
```

### Use the customized component:
Now you can use the customized component throughout your app, and the custom styles defined in the
theme will be applied.

```jsx copy filename="component.ts"
import { Button } from '@vastly/ui';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button colorScheme="brand">Custom Button</Button>
  );
}
```

</Steps>

These steps should help you get started with customizing a theme using Vastly UI. You can explore
the [Chakra UI documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/) for more advanced customization options and available components.
