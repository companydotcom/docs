Login to your Vastly account and get the credentials you need to build.

## Usage

The vastly login command allows you to login to your Vastly account through Vastly CLI.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Note that to login to Vastly you need a verified Vastly account with a valid email previously set
  up by one of our team members. Contact us if you are having problems.
</Callout>

```bash copy filename="terminal"
   vastly login
```

Using the Vastly CLI, you can log in to Vastly to get local credentials in order to access various
Vastly features.

When `vastly login` is run, follow the on screen prompt which asks for a valid email. If successful,
you should recieve an email shortly with a unique link that automatically logs you in. Once you are
succesfully logged in, you are safe to close that window.
