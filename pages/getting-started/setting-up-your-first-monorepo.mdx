# Setting Up Your First Monorepo With Wave

import { Callout, Tabs, Tab } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

## Installation

To create a new Wave monorepo, use our [create-wave-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-wave-app) package.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Note that to properly deploy your Wave app, and access certain features, you need a verified Vastly account previously set up by one of our team members. Contact us if you are having problems.
</Callout>

After installing your Wave app, take a look at the "readme" file in the root of your monorepo, it has more quickstart guides to try out.
For more in depth details about what you can build in a Wave monorepo, check out the [Build](https://docs.vastly.is/build/frameworks) section of these docs.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy filename="terminal"
    pnpx create-wave-app
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy filename="terminal"
    npx create-wave-app@latest
    ```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Wave CLI

Once your monorepo is set up, you can use the Wave CLI to help accelerate building your app. For example, try running `npx wave generate service` to set up your first micro service.

## Vastly CLI

We also provide our Vastly [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vastly/cli) to help you manage your Vastly account, insrastructure, and deployments. You can run the Vastly CLI from within your Wave Monorepo by running `npx vastly`.
