# Sync and Deploy
This documentation provides an overview of how to utilize the sync and deploy system for applications. This system automates the deployment process, maintains a single source of truth for secrets and environment variables, and ensures consistency across different environments.
## Overview

<Callout>
Ensure the following secrets are configured in the repository settings before proceeding:
 * `OIDC_IAM_ROLE`: Account specific IAM role to retrieve AWS credentials. This is necessary for accessing CloudFormation and the [`vastly env`](/vastly-cli) service.
</Callout>

These workflows will require some inputs to be passed from one to the other, as well as some optional inputs with default values. Here's a quick breakdown.
1. **App Specific Workflow**:
    <UnorderedList>
      <ListItem>Exists as part of the <font color="orange">`create-wave-app`</font> template</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Triggers on pushes to specific branches and paths</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Allows for manual deployment via the GitHub Actions interface. Users can select the environment (uat, prod) during manual execution</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Deployment library agnostic</ListItem>
    </UnorderedList><br/>
2. **Reusable Actions:**
    <UnorderedList>
      <ListItem>Exists in the <font color="orange">`shared-workflows`</font> repository</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Syncs secrets from DynamoDB to GitHub</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Exports environment variables using github artifacts</ListItem>
    </UnorderedList>

## Usage
<Steps>
### Edit

Configure <font color="orange">`deploy-app-example.yml`</font> to fit your specific needs. See the <font color="orange">`README.md`</font> of your Wave App for more info<br/><br/>

<OrderedList>
  <ListItem>Change the paths in the <font color="orange">`on:`</font> section.</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Configure the <font color="orange">`options`</font> with the deployment environments that exists in github.</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Replace the path for the <font color="orange">`Download .env file`</font> step to point to the app that is being deployed.</ListItem>
  <ListItem>In the space provided, place any custom logic that is needed before deployment.</ListItem>
  <ListItem>In the <font color="orange">`Deploy`</font> step, replace the run script with the deploy command of your choosing.</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Lastly, rename the file and names of any steps needed.</ListItem>
</OrderedList>

### Trigger Workflow

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>Push changes to the main branch (or any specified branch) that affect files in the specified path, example <font color="orange">`[apps/client, apps/admin]`</font></ListItem>
<ListItem>Or manually trigger via the GitHub Actions UI by selecting the desired environment</ListItem>
</OrderedList>

### Monitor Workflow progress

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>Follow the workflow's progress in the GitHub Actions tab.</ListItem>
<ListItem>Ensure that the app is successfully deployed to the selected environment.</ListItem>
</OrderedList>
</Steps>


## Workflow Breakdown

#### Inputs

`environment`: string <font color="orange"><i>[defaults to uat]</i></font>

### Reusable Pre-deployment
These are reusable actions that can function separately or work in tandem as a composite action.

#### Sync secrets from DynamoDB to GitHub

This action is designed to dynamically synchronize secrets from an AWS DynamoDB table to GitHub based on environment. By using a single source of truth, we won't have to worry about missing or mismatching secrets or variables.
* fetches secrets from dynamo
* fetches secrets from github
* compares the two and updates secrets in github
* deletes any secrets that do not exist in dynamo

#### Export env
This action uses the <font color="orange">`vastly env`</font> service to pull environment specific envs and uploads them as an artifact to be used later in the deployment process

### App Specific Workflow
This workflow will live at the root level of the client account repository, in its <font color="orange">`./github/workflows`</font> directory.

#### Steps Overview
* Checkout client repo
* Configure AWS credentials (environment based)
* Install Node
* Install pnpm and dependencies
* Calls the reusable pre-deployment actions from the shared workflows
* Downloads the env artifact from the previous step (path needs to point to the app being deployed)
* Any custom app logic necessary for deployment
* Deploy the app using whichever library: <font color="orange">`pnpm sst deploy --stage uat`</font>
* Deletes the env artifact
## Example

```

## Summary
With the above workflow files in place, you can now implement a robust and automated system for syncing secrets and deploying applications across multiple environments. This system ensures that your secrets are always up-to-date and that deployments are consistent and reliable.

### Future Adaptations and Improvements
  - Make the App Specific workflow app agnostic
  - Create a better strategy for injecting the <font color="orange">`OIDC_IAM_ROLE`</font> before workflows start
